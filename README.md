# Python Live Project
## Introduction
For the end of my Python course at the Tech Academy, I worked with my peers on a live project utilizing Azure DevOps and Agile/Scrum principles. This 2-week sprint utilized various Python and Django features in order to create databases, interact with APIs, and use data scraping. 

Throughout the 2-week sprint, we were assigned various stories to complete. In addition to applying my skills in Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS, I was also able to apply my knowledge in utilizing version control. The advantage of the live project is that I am expected to create my own branches, keep it up to date with the master branch, commit changes, test my code, and make pull requests to the main branch. This process, in addition to the daily stand-ups and agile/scrum methodology, gave me great sense of working on a working development team. 

### Story 1: Building the Basic App
I created an app within the existing project using CommandLine and registering the app with the main project. I also created base and home templates with will build the basic front-end of my app's homepage.

### Story 2: Create the Model
I created a database model for the app I am building: a collection of Portland, OR's best restaurant dishes. After creating the model, I created a model form to take in user input and a view function to render that form on the page and save the input into the database. 

### Story 3: Display all items from the database

### Story 4: Details Page

### Story 5: Edit and Delete Functions

### Story 6:
